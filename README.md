# WEBCOUCH_

A self-hostable web app built on Laravel 12 for storing and watching videos with other people. Playback synchronisation is done via [Laravel Reverb](https://reverb.laravel.com/) using WebSockets.

**DISCLAIMER:** This app is quite basic and was merely built to serve as a proof of concept over the course of a weekend for a school project about messaging.
